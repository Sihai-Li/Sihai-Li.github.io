## Education
- M.S., Computer Science | Georgia Institute of Technology (_Jan 2023 - present_)	
- Ph.D., Neuroscience | Wake Forest School of Medicine (_July 2015 - May 2020_)

## Research Experience
**Postdoctoral Scholar @ University of Chicago (_Aug 2021 - Present_)**
-  Implemented large-scale in vivo electrophysiology recording technique collecting data from multiple
brain areas on awake non-human primates to elucidate the contributions of distinct brain areas in
predictive coding
- Initiated and led a research project with collection in vivo neurophysiological data from awake nonhuman primates
- Inactivated specific brain areas via pharmacological methods
- Collaborated with computational neuroscientists to interpret neurophysiological data

**Graduate Researcher @ Wake Forest School of Medicine (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Collected neurophysiological evidence from awake nonhuman primates to investigate the
involvement of prefrontal and parietal cortex in working memory. Identified the correlation of neural
activity fluctuations with behavioral deficits. Applied dimensionality reduction (PCA) and
populational decoding (SVM) to illustrate representations of working memory information from
neural activities
- Obtained in vivo electrophysiology to collect data from non-human primates
- Collaborated with team of physicians and technicians to acquire non-human primate MRI data
- Supervised and trained 5 research technicians and graduate students to start on hand nonhuman
primate experiments
- Analyzed and interpreted neurophysiological data using MATLAB, Microsoft Access and Python
- Authored 5 publications on top-tier neuroscience journals
